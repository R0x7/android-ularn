# Atmosphere: weather, day/night and Polaroid photos

## Weather and day/night (`WILDF_WEATHER`)

The town above the dungeon has a clock and a sky.

* **The clock:** a day is 1200 turns (an hour is 50 turns; a new game
  starts at 08:00). Night is 21:00 to 05:59; you are told when dusk falls and when
  dawn breaks. The HUD shows a sun or a moon after the level name, and the
  map is tinted: warm at dawn and dusk, deep blue at night (never more than
  40% darker).
* **Weather:** clear, rain, snow ("Snow! In Larn!") or a storm, changing
  every 200-600 turns ("It starts to rain.", "Thunder rolls over the
  mountains."). It keeps changing while you are underground; you hear about
  it when you climb back out. Rain and snow drift over the open ground, stars
  come out over unexplored squares at night.
* **What it does:** at night random monsters turn up twice as often on the
  surface, and now and then "You hear the pitter-patter of a thousand tiny
  feet": 8-12 lemmings enter at the east edge and march west across the map
  (they leave at the west edge, unless they find you first). In a storm,
  lightning occasionally strikes a monster near you for 20 damage (and the
  screen flashes).
* **Settings:** "Reduce weather effects" keeps the tint and the HUD icon but
  stops the drifting rain and snow (thinner and still), the twinkling and
  the lightning flashes. "Weather and day/night on the surface" turns it all
  off; like every Wild feature it is stored with the character when created.

## Polaroid photo mode (`WILDF_PHOTO`)

* **Take a photo:** in-game menu → "Take a photo", or give an on-screen
  button the action "Take a photo" (Edit controls → a button → Action). The
  map as you see it (weather included) becomes an instant photo with a
  handwritten caption ("Ann the novice explorer — level 3, turn 1234"), the
  date, a vignette and a few pixel stickers. The screen flashes and clicks
  (through Dungeon Radio's sound effects when the Radio is on).
* **Where it goes:** Pictures/Ularn Wild in the gallery, then a Share
  button. Android 10 and later need no permission; Android 7-9 ask for
  storage access the first time.
* **Auto-photo:** with "Auto-photo on death / victory" (on by default) the
  final scene is snapped by itself. The newest photo shows under "Last
  photo" in Statistics & achievements.
* **Settings:** "Polaroid photo mode" in Wild features removes the menu
  entry, the button action and the auto-photo.
